## Current Status 🔄

### Servers Running:
- **Frontend**: http://100.97.49.122:3000 ✅
- **Backend**: http://100.97.49.122:5001 ✅

### Recent Fix Applied:
- JWT tokens now use string user IDs instead of integers
- Comprehensive logging system active
- Logs located at `/backend/logs/`

### Expected Behavior:
- Login should work and return valid JWT tokens
- `/auth/me` endpoint should validate tokens successfully
- User should remain logged in instead of being redirected to login
