# Month Navigation Fix - 2025-06-24

## Issue
Month navigation buttons got stuck - couldn't navigate back to previous months after going forward/backward.

## Root Cause
JavaScript `setMonth()` method has day overflow issues when current date doesn't exist in target month (e.g., May 31 → April has only 30 days).

## Fix Applied
Replaced unreliable `setMonth()` with manual month/year parsing:
- Parse YYYY-MM format directly 
- Use first day of month to avoid overflow
- Manual month arithmetic with proper formatting

## Result
✅ Month navigation now works bidirectionally without getting stuck
