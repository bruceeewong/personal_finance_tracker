# Next Tasks & Improvements

## Immediate Testing üß™

### 1. Verify JWT Fix
- [ ] Test login functionality with new string-based JWT tokens
- [ ] Verify `/auth/me` endpoint works correctly  
- [ ] Confirm user remains logged in without redirect loops
- [ ] Check that dashboard loads properly after login

### 2. Review Log Output
- [ ] Check `backend/logs/api.log` for clean request/response flow
- [ ] Verify JWT operations show successful creation and validation
- [ ] Ensure no error logs appear during normal authentication flow
