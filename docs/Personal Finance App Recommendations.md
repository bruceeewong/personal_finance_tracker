# Personal Finance App Recommendations

## Executive Summary

Based on your specific requirements for managing multiple accounts (credit cards, checking accounts, and crypto wallets), shared expense tracking with your girlfriend, and investment monitoring, I've researched and analyzed the best personal finance apps available in 2025.
