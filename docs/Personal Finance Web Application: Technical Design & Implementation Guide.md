Marshmallow provides serialization and validation for API endpoints, ensuring data integrity and providing clear error messages for invalid inputs. This is particularly important for financial applications where data accuracy is critical and user-friendly error handling improves the overall experience.

### Database and Storage

SQLite serves as the primary database for local deployment, offering zero-configuration setup and excellent performance for the expected data volumes. SQLite's ACID compliance ensures data integrity for financial transactions, while its single-file storage model simplifies backup and migration procedures. The database design maintains PostgreSQL compatibility to enable future scaling without application code changes.

The file system handles document storage for receipts, statements, and other financial documents. A structured directory approach organizes files by user, date, and category, with database references maintaining relationships between documents and transactions. This hybrid approach keeps the database lightweight while providing comprehensive document management capabilities.

### Development and Deployment Tools

Node.js and npm manage frontend dependencies and build processes, providing access to the extensive JavaScript ecosystem. The Create React App toolchain handles build optimization, development server, and production bundling with minimal configuration overhead.

Git provides version control with a branching strategy that supports feature development, testing, and production releases. The repository structure separates frontend and backend code while maintaining clear integration points.

## Security Considerations

Security forms a fundamental aspect of the application architecture, given the sensitive nature of financial data. The security model addresses authentication, authorization, data protection, and secure communication while maintaining usability for the target user base.

Authentication utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with a dual-token approach including access tokens for API requests and refresh tokens for session management. Access tokens have short expiration times (15 minutes) to limit exposure risk, while refresh tokens enable seamless user experience with longer validity periods (7 days). The token-based approach eliminates server-side session storage requirements while providing robust security for API access.

Password security implements bcrypt hashing with configurable work factors, ensuring protection against rainbow table and brute force attacks. The application enforces strong password requirements including minimum length, character diversity, and common password blacklisting. Password reset functionality uses secure token generation with time-limited validity and single-use constraints.

Data protection employs encryption at rest for sensitive financial data including account numbers, balances, and transaction details. The application uses AES-256 encryption with securely managed keys stored separately from encrypted data. Database connections utilize SSL/TLS encryption to protect data in transit, even for local deployments.

API security includes rate limiting to prevent abuse, input validation to prevent injection attacks, and CORS configuration to control cross-origin requests. All API endpoints require authentication except for login and registration, with role-based access control enabling shared access for couples while maintaining individual privacy controls.

The application implements comprehensive audit logging for all financial operations, including transaction creation, modification, and deletion. Audit logs include user identification, timestamp, operation details, and IP address information to support security monitoring and compliance requirements.

## Mobile-First Design Principles

The mobile-first design approach ensures optimal user experience across all device types while prioritizing the mobile browser experience that forms the primary use case. This design philosophy influences every aspect of the user interface, from layout structure to interaction patterns and performance optimization.

Responsive layout design utilizes CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible, mobile-optimized layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. The design system defines breakpoints at 320px (small mobile), 768px (tablet), and 1024px (desktop) with mobile-first media queries ensuring optimal performance on resource-constrained devices. Component layouts prioritize vertical scrolling over horizontal navigation, reducing cognitive load and improving one-handed usability.

Touch-first interaction design implements larger touch targets (minimum 44px) for all interactive elements, ensuring accessibility for users with varying dexterity levels. Gesture support includes swipe navigation for transaction lists, pull-to-refresh for data updates, and long-press for contextual actions. The interface minimizes complex hover states and multi-step interactions that perform poorly on touch devices.

Performance optimization focuses on mobile network conditions and device capabilities. The application implements lazy loading for non-critical components, image optimization for different screen densities, and aggressive caching strategies for frequently accessed data. Bundle splitting ensures fast initial page loads with progressive enhancement for advanced features.

Typography and visual hierarchy adapt to mobile viewing conditions with larger base font sizes (16px minimum), high contrast ratios for outdoor visibility, and clear visual separation between interactive and static elements. The color scheme provides sufficient contrast for accessibility compliance while maintaining visual appeal across different display technologies.

Navigation design emphasizes simplicity and discoverability with a bottom navigation bar for primary functions, hamburger menu for secondary features, and breadcrumb navigation for deep hierarchies. The navigation structure minimizes the number of taps required to reach common functions while providing clear visual feedback for user actions.
